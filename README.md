## 📌 Project Overview
**TMMLU+** (Traditional Chinese Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is a state-of-the-art benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically within the linguistic and cultural context of **Taiwan**.

The benchmark includes **66 subjects** covering STEM, Social Sciences, Humanities, and professional certifications (e.g., Real Estate, Clinical Psychology, and Law). This leaderboard provides an interactive platform to compare model performance across these diverse domains.

## 📊 Live Interactive Leaderboard
We provide an interactive dashboard that offers more than just raw scores:
- **Search & Filter:** Find specific models instantly.
- **Visual Analytics:** Compare performance via Discipline Radar Maps and Category Bar Charts.
- **Nested Drill-down:** Click on a model to see Major Disciplines, and expand those to see scores for all 66+ individual subjects.
- **General Benchmarks:** Includes external evaluations like DRCD, TW-RAG, and GSM8K.

### One Final Step for the Submission Button
As mentioned before, for that blue "Submit Your Model Results" button to work, you must create the template file. 



1. Create a folder named `.github` (at the same level as `docs`).
2. Inside it, create a folder named `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
3. Inside that, create a file named `model_submission.md` and paste the template content I provided in our previous message.

**Your project is now officially complete and ready for public sharing! Would you like me to help you draft a LinkedIn or Twitter post to announce it?**
